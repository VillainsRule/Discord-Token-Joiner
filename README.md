# Discord Token Joiner (& booster)
This is a simple tool to mass join Discord tokens into a server.<br>Original tool credit to **[@uutu](https://github.com/TahaGorme)**. It is now being maintained by me.<br><br>
**Due to potential future Discord API changes, tokens may be "locked" after you use this tool. Use at your own risk.**<br>
